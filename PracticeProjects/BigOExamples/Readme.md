# Big O Notation Practice Project
###### Practice Project 8

## Project: Test out some Sorting Algorithms to see the Computational Time required - Big O(n)
*Purpose: Get a Visualization of Big O notation*

Write a few Sorting Algorithms and compare the amount of time that they take to complete.
It should have the following Class Structure:
* Main: Houses all Main Things
  * main(...) -> Runs the Program by generating numbers and sorting them using different methods
  * Generate(int length) [Reuturns array of generated numbers] : Generate a list of numbers that is N elements long
  * bubbleSort(int[] array) [Returns sorted Array] : Sorts the Array using [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
  * InsertionSort(int[] array) [Returns sorted Array] : Sorts Array using [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
  * BinarySearch(int[] sortedArray) [Returns boolean] : Recursively Searches a sorted Array to see if the element is there

This is a neat Visualizer I found that can visualize many sorting Algorithms.
