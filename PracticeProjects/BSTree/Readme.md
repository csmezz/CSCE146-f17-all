# Binary Search Trees
###### Practice Project 10

## Project: Create a Self-sorting Binary Search Tree in Java
*Purpose: To understand how a Binary Search Tree works*

This Tree sould be able to take in and sort the values at the same time. It should implement the following functions:
* Constructor() : Creates a new blank tree
* insert(T data) : inserts new data into the tree
* find(T data) [Returns true if found] : Find a piece of data
* remove() [Returns removed Data] : Remove the top of the tree
* remove(T data) [Returns removed Data] : Find and remove the data in the parameter
