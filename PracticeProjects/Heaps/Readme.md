# Heaps
###### Practice Project 12

## Project: Create a heap using Arrays
*Purpose: To Better understand how heaps work, and how they are related to trees*

Create a Heap using Arrays that can store data of Generic Type T. It should implement the following functions:
* Constructor() : Creates a Blank Heap, containing no data
* push(T data) : Push a piece of data onto the heap
* pop() [Returns Head of Heap] : Returns and deletes the head of the heap
* peek() [Returns the Head of the Heap] : Returns the head f the heap, but doesn't delete it.

***

## Challenge: Implement a Find function

* find(T data) [Returns true if the data is found] : Find a piece of data in the heap
