# Linked List Recursive Search
###### Practice Project 5

## Project: Make a Recursive Searching Method for a Linked List
*Purpose: Review Recursion and tie it into something that is being used in class right now*

Make a Recursive Method to search through the LinkedList and finda given piece of data. Start with the head, and iterate through the list until either the data is found or the list ends.
It should implement the following Functions:
* search(Node, DataToBeFound) [returns boolean] : Returns true if found, nad false if the end of the list is reached
* search(Node) [returns boolean] : Starts the Search, and calls search(head, Node). Returns whatever the search(...) returns
* function(Params) [Returns Something] : Description of what the Function does

## Challenge: Find a more efficient way to search through data

Simply think of more efficient ways that data can be searched through. (Hint: It may involve sorting it first!)
