# Linked Lists with Strings
###### Practice Project 2

## Project: Make a Linked List that can store Strings
*Purpose: Better understand how Linked Lists work in Java*

This Practice Project should implement a singly-Linked List that Stores Strings (one in each link) and implements the following Methods:

* Constructor : Creates an empty Linked List Structore
* Insert(String) : Inserts a new Node AFTER the Current Position
* Iterate : Move to the next Node, for now make it move to the beginning if it reaches the end of the list.
* Replace(String) : Replaces the Current Position's Node
* Remove : Removes the node at the Current Position
* Append(String) : Adds a Node to the end of the list
* Prepend(String) : Adds a Node to the Beginning of the list
* get [Returns String] : Retreives the String at the current position

***

## Challenge: Implement Linked List Index

Imagine that the Linked List has indicies at each of the positions of the List. Implement this in the Following Functions

* Insert(String, int index) : Insert a Node at the following position in the List
* Replace(String, int index) : Replace the String at the position in the list
* Remove(int index) : Remove Node at given Index
* get(int index) [Returns String] : Retreives String at given Index
