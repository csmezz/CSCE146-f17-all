# Binary Search Tree - Array Implementation
###### Practice Project 11

## Project: Write a Binary Search Tree that uses an Array to store the data rather than Nodes
*Purpose: To understand how to do another implementation of a BST*

This project will be the implementation of a Binary Search Tree using an array to store the data. It should implement the following functions:
* function(Params) [Returns Something] : Description of what the Function does
* ArrayBST() : Creates a new, blank Binary Search Tree
* ArrayBST(int) : Creates a new Binary Search Tree where the array is the size of the int parameter
* insert(T data) : Insert the data into the tree
* printBreadthOrder() : Prints the Array in Breadth order to the Standard Out
* printPostOrder() : Prints the Array in Post Order to the Standard Out

***

## Challenge: Implement additional functions for the BST

Add the following functions:
**You will not be tested on Delete() in an Array BST**
* delete(T data) : Finds and Deletes data in a tree
