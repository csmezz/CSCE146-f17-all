All Sessions are in the Thomas Cooper Library room 412, unless otherwise noted. Times are:
* Sunday -> 6:00p - 6:50p
* Monday -> 7:00p - 7:50p
* Tuesday -> 8:00p - 8:50p

You will find materials that I used in my SI Sessions here. The Directories are as Follows:
* Worksheets -> Paper Worksheets with short problems on them
* PracticeProjects -> Larger Practice Projects that go over concepts taught in class
* docs -> Extra Documents that you probably won't need.
* Solutions -> Solutions to homework and Labs (after they are collected) that people ask me to do

You should also check out the Wiki, which has extra information about these sessions.
