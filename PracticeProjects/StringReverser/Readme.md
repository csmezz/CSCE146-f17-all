# String Reverser (Using Stacks)
###### Practice Project 4

## Project: Use a Stack to Reverse a String
*Purpose: Learn how to implement and use a Stack Data Structure*

This practice Project should implement a Generic Stack using either a Linked Structure or an Array-based Structure.
The Stack Implementation should use a Generic interface to define the methods, which are as follows for type **T**:
* push(T data) : Add a piece of Data to the Stack.
* pop() [Returns T] : Remove a piece of data from the stack, and return it.
* peek() [Returns T] : Return the top piece of data from the stack without destroying it.
* size() [Returns int] : Return the size of the stack.

From this, implement the actual data structure using a Linked List Data Structure.
It should implement the above methods, since it implements the above interface.

After implementing the Stack, write a driver that can take a String of characters and reverse the order of the characters using the stack.

## Challenge: Implement the Stack using an Array

Implement the Stack Data Structure using an Array. If the stack overflows, then for now ignore it.
